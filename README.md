# Spiking-Neural-Networks-SNN-

Creating a simple Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) model involves understanding that SNNs operate differently from traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). 
Instead of using continuous activations, they process and transmit information via discrete "spikes," mimicking how biological neurons function.

# Understand the Basic Components of SNN

1) Neuron model: A commonly used model is the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron.
2) Synapses: Define how neurons are connected.
3) Input encoding: Convert data into spikes (e.g., using Poisson encoding).
4) Simulation: Define a simulation time to observe neuron behavior.
